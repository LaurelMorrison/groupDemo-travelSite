# Citrus Circus Travel Site

## Project Outline

The task in this group project is to use your newfound skills of automation, and rebuild your travel brochure site using objects, arrays, components, modules, CSS selectors, Flexbox, semantic HTML, and data providers.

Each city, each landmark, and each famous citizen must be represented in application state as objects. This means that you will need multiple separate data providers, list components, and HTML representation components for each page.

A suggestion is to create multiple sub-directories under `scripts`. If, for example, your team chose Turkey, Morocco, Tanzania, and Indonesia, you would have the following main modules.

## Requirements

1. Use semantic HTML tags
1. Use CSS imports
1. Use good CSS naming conventions, prefereably the BEM format
1. Use Flexbox
1. Must decide on a consistent experience across all pages. Fonts, color scheme, layout, and structure.
